# 57 Challenges :jigsaw:

These are my solutions to the exercises from the book "Exercises for Programmers: 57 Challenges to Develop Your Coding Skills" by Brian P. Hogan, published by The Pragmatic Programmers, and availabel. The exercises are published language agnostic, and I chose to complete them in Rust :crab:.

57 is a bit of an arbitrary number. I wonder if this is a reference to Heinz's 57 varieties.
